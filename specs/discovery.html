		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A common problem to building interoperable solutions is having a mechanism for a client to introspect an API or end-point
		to learn if the target application supports a set of capabilities.  Sometimes the client applications may provide limited
		or no features based on what is discovered.  An example of discover needs includes a person using a quality management tool 
		that wants to be able to record a bug in a bug tracking tool.  The integration from the quality management tool will want to
		be able to do a number of things on behalf of the user and provide an optional integrated experience to streamline the
		users workflow.  Therefore the discovery needs include: authenticating, knowing that the target tool is capable of 
		receiving creation requests for bugs, whether it can be handled via a user interface, what fields are required and
		types of data, and also if the bug record can be prefilled with some data from the test currently being executed.</p>

	<p><em>TODO: needed for public review version of standards-track specifications, more details 
	in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html#_Toc170119664">TC Handbook</a>.
	Some examples: <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ldpwg/raw-file/default/ldp.html#conformance">LDP</a>,

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>Some key usage scenarios that motivate a number of requirements for discovery.</p>
		<p>Determine if the target tool supports:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a certain authentication model (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, HTTP Basic)</li>
			<li>creating bug records (resources of a given kind)</li>
			<li>user interface previews</li>
			<li>user interface dialogs for creating or selecting bugs (resources of given types)</li>
			<li>prefilling dialogs</li>
			<li>describing the constraints on a bug creation or update request (shapes associated with certain operations)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Additionally there is motivation to establish a common way for tools to support similar mechanisms so
		that each new capability doesn't introduce a new discovery model.  It is also desired to have capabilities defined, whether
		within a standards development group or proprietary, to be able to leverage a similar approach to discovery.</p>
		<p>The basis for how clients discovery capability should be based on the methods established by [[LDP]] and [[HTTP11]].</p>

		<section id="creation">
			<h2>Checking for creation of a certain type of resource</h2>
			
			<section id="doesCreate"><h2 class="normal">
				The existence of an <code>Accept-Post</code> header on an HTTP response to a given Request-URI will
				indicate that both an HTTP POST is accepted for authorized requests and which content types are support
				in the entity body of an HTTP POST request. See [[LDP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#header-accept-post">
				section about <code>Accept-Post</code></a>.
			</h2></section>
			
			<section id="isLDPC"><h2 class="normal">
				The existence of a <code>Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container&gt;; rel="type"</code> header on 
				an HTTP response to a given Request-URI will indicate that the resource is a LDP Container. See [[LDP]]
				<a href="ldpc-linktypehdr">section about <code>Link</code> header and resource types</a>.
			</h2></section>

			<section id="createsTypes"><h2 class="normal">
				The target URI of a <code>Link: &lt;<em>type-URI</em>&lt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#creationType"</code> 
				header on an HTTP response to a given Request-URI will indicate the <code><em>type-URI</em></code> 
				(i.e. <code>rdf:type</code>) for the type of resources that SHOULD be able to be created for
				authorized requests against the LDP Container.  Note: since there is always some time between when the
				test is done and when the creation request is sent, and that there may additional server enforced constraints
				on the creation resource representation, there is no guarantee that a future creation request will succeed.

			<div class='note'>TODO: Use headers, poll to see if needed a standard predicate for feeding indexes</div>
