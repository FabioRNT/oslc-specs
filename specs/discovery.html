		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A common problem to building interoperable solutions is having a mechanism for a client to introspect an API or end-point
		to learn if the target application supports a set of capabilities.  Sometimes the client applications may provide limited
		or no features based on what is discovered.  An example of discover needs includes a person using a quality management tool 
		that wants to be able to record a bug in a bug tracking tool.  The integration from the quality management tool will want to
		be able to do a number of things on behalf of the user and provide an optional integrated experience to streamline the
		users workflow.  Therefore the discovery needs include: authenticating, knowing that the target tool is capable of 
		receiving creation requests for bugs, whether it can be handled via a user interface, what fields are required and
		types of data, and also if the bug record can be prefilled with some data from the test currently being executed.</p>
		<p></p>

		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's
			Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],  Hyper-text
			Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
		<dl>
			<dt class='loc-heading'><dfn>Discovery</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The act of an OSLC Client to be able to determine if an OSLC Server supports a given capability.  It also applies
			to applications that do not operate as a client or server, for example running within a web browser.</dd>

	<section id="conformance">
	<p><em>TODO: needed for public review version of standards-track specifications, more details 
	in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html#_Toc170119664">TC Handbook</a>.
	Some examples: <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ldpwg/raw-file/default/ldp.html#conformance">LDP</a>, 
	<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html#S-CONFORMANCE">UBL</a></em></p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>Some key usage scenarios that motivate a number of requirements for discovery.</p>
		<p>Determine if the target tool supports:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a certain authentication model (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, HTTP Basic)</li>
			<li>creating bug records (resources of a given kind)</li>
			<li>user interface previews</li>
			<li>user interface dialogs for creating or selecting bugs (resources of given types)</li>
			<li>prefilling dialogs</li>
			<li>describing the constraints on a bug creation or update request (shapes associated with certain operations)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Additionally there is motivation to establish a common way for tools to support similar mechanisms so
		that each new capability doesn't introduce a new discovery model.  It is also desired to have capabilities defined, whether
		within a standards development group or proprietary, to be able to leverage a similar approach to discovery.</p>
		<p>The basis for how clients discovery capability should be based on the methods established by [[LDP]] and [[HTTP11]].</p>

		<h2>Capability</h2>
		<p><em>The title of this section is flexible.  Since the title of this spec should match what it does, it 
		may not make sense to repeat it here.  This section is intended to capture the conformance clauses 
		(ie, the 'meat' of the spec).</em></p>
		
		<section id="clause">
			<h2>Clause section</h2>
			<p><em>Give your section title/id something meaningful and simple, don't include the actual section number.</em></p>
			<p><em><strong>Writing conformance clauses/statements: </strong> Create individual sections for each conformance clause.
			Each clause should cleanly map to a test case, see [[LDP]] spec and <a href="http://w3c.github.io/ldp-testsuite">LDP testsuite</a> for an example of this model.</em></p>
			
			<section id="clausea"><h2 class="normal">
				OSLC specifications MUST provide [[RFC2116]] keywords that SHOULD be in ALL CAPS and MAY include client and/or server needs.
			</h2></section>

			<section id="clauseb"><h2 class="normal">
				It is RECOMMENDED that OSLC specifications include examples whenever possible.
