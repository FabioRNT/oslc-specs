		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The evolution of OSLC started from some simple documents that defined some XML and JSON formats and some
		interactions based on RESTful HTTP web services.  These were labeled "OSLC 1.0".  As a number of "1.0" specifications
		emerged, common patterns and reuse opportunities emerged.  This then led to the creation of OSLC Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]].
		From this, domain specifications were developed and other common specifications.  The OSLC Core 2.0 evolved from 
		1.0 in that is strengthen its definition of the use of RESTful HTTP web services and adopted an existing standard-based
		approach to representing a data model that was flexible and had multiple representation formats, namely RDF [[rdf11-concepts]].
		Now that OSLC Core 3.0 specifications are based on [[LINKED-DATA]] and namely the Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], 
		there is a less-disruptive change from 2.0 to 3.0, as conceptually they are built on the same foundation: Linked Data (HTTP and RDF).
		Some of the underlying concepts and vocabularies may have changed in some areas, this document will address
		how best to co-exist with 2.0 existing implementations.  Which in the end, will mostly be able just producing a few more 
		RDF triples (or statements) in some of the responses or additional HTTP response headers.</p>
		<p>The goals are not to define how to future proof tools or define a comprehensive versioning model.  Though the
		approach follows established best practices based on Web Architecture [[webarch]] and evolving RDF data models [[rdf11-concepts]].</p>

		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's

		<p>No additional terminology defined.</p>

		<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h2>Changes from OSLC Core 2.0</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes the capabilities from OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications and 
what changes have occurred within OSLC Core 3.0. <strong>It is not a complete list of all differences.</strong>
As additional OSLC Core specifications are published, this table may be out of date and changes needed.  The 
individual specifications and associated TCs will produce any needed backwards/forwards or cross dependency collateral.</p>
    
<p>Many capabilities are no longer specified in OSLC 3.0 because they are part of the W3C Linked Data
    Platform 1.0 [[LDP]]. Servers can continue to support both 2.0 and 3.0
    capabilities for backwards compatibility with 2.0 clients.</p>

<p>Some capabilities are in both OSLC 2.0 and OSLC 3.0, but their
    implementation has changed. One example is Resource Preview
    [[OSLCPreview3]].</p>

<p>Note that the required resource representations have changed. In 2.0, these were often specialized
at a domain level, such as RDF/XML and  OSLC JSON representations may been required. Turtle [[turtle]] and JSON-LD
    [[JSON-LD]] are required instead, this is a [[LDP]] requirement.</p>

<section><h2>Making client that works with either 2.0 or 3.0 servers</h2>

	<section><h2>Server/endpoint discovery</h2>
		<p>In order for a client to work with as many possible combinations of servers, it will need be written to be
		flexible and tolerant of changes.  It should be expected that if a server returns URLs from 3.0 discovery mechanisms, that the
		client shouldn't expect to see that server switch back to 2.0 mechanisms.</p>
		
		<p>3.0 clients should not send the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header, if they do, use the value of "3.0".</p>
		
		<p>When clients are expecting a URL that is an OSLC 2.0 Service Provider document, they will clearly find a resource of type 
		<code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> and inlined resources of type <code>oslc:Service</code>.</p>
		<p>When clients are expecting a URL that is an OSLC 3.0 server, they will clearly find a resource of type or subtype of <code>ldp:Container</code>.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section><h2>Creation of resources of a certain type</h2>
		<p>Based on the approach illustrated in the previous section to determine which version of server you are connected to:</p>
		<p>In 2.0, the client will look into an oslc:Server resource, then domain type, then creation factory and finally the type associated with it.</p>
		<p>In 3.0, the client will <a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/discovery.html#creation">inspect the response headers</a>.</p>
	</section>
	
</section>

<section><h2>Making server that works with either 2.0 or 3.0 clients</h2>

	<section><h2>Server/endpoint discovery</h2>
		<p>OSLC 2.0 clients should provide a HTTP request header of <code>OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0</code> which servers can respond with a 2.0 only response.</p>
		<p>If the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header is not provided on HTTP requests or the value is "3.0", servers can assume the client is at least a 3.0 client and
		prefer 3.0-only responses.</p>
		
		<p>Optionally, a server can detect when a client uses a URL to make a request for a different version of a resource than the server is expecting.  The
		server can redirect the client to the appropriate URL, using the appropriate HTTP 3xx range redirect codes such as 301 (Moved permanently).</p>
			
		<p>Additionally, servers could decide to expose additional HTTP response headers, RDF triples and HTTP OPTIONS responses to provide a
		single view of a given resource URL that may have been reserved for a given 2.0 or 3.0 concept.  There may be advantages to reusing URLs say
		for 2.0 creation factories and 3.0 LDP Containers, though in some cases there may be some drawbacks.</p>
		
		<div class='note'>NOTE: Do we need to articulate every resource type?</div>
	</section>

</section>

<section><h2>Gracefully upgrading server from 2.0 to 3.0</h2>
	<p>This only applies to client's that support 3.0.  As in the case if the client only supported 2.0, it would only request that and use that.
	Client applications has stored these references:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Service Provider Catalog</li>
		<li>Service Provider</li>
		<li>Linked to Resource</li>
	</ul>
	<p>2.0 client applications shouldn't store other URLs or data, other than for caching purposes.</p> 
</section>


<section>
	<h2>Discovery</h2>
	<p class="todo">TODO: How to align with: ServiceProvider, ServiceProviderCatalog, Service, CreationFactory, QueryCapability, domain</p>

    <section><h2>Find v2 oslc:ServiceProvider document</h2>
	    <p>In OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications, OSLC Servers (Providers) would be required to expose a resource which has an <code>rdf:type</code>
	    of <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code>.</p>
    </section>
	
</section>

<section>
	<h2>OSLC-Core-Version</h2>
	<p>Deprecated.  Technically, there is no reason to carry it forward in 3.0.  Each capability should be able to independently describe
	how to discover it using methods established by LDP such as HTTP response headers (Link relations, Accept-Post, ...) [[OSLCDiscovery3]].</p>
	<p>Implementations that have previously tested for the value of this parameter, should ensure their logic properly accounts for
	values that may not be "2.0".  As some may provide the value of "3.0", which shouldn't be seen as an error but instead as just
	an informative header.</p>
