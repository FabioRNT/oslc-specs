		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The evolution of OSLC started from some simple documents that defined some XML and JSON formats and some
		interactions based on RESTful HTTP web services.  These were labeled "OSLC 1.0".  As a number of "1.0" specifications
		emerged, common patterns and reuse opportunities emerged.  This then led to the creation of OSLC Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]].
		From this, domain specifications were developed and other common specifications.  The OSLC Core 2.0 evolved from 
		1.0 in that is strengthen its definition of the use of RESTful HTTP web services and adopted an existing standard-based
		approach to representing a data model that was flexible and had multiple representation formats, namely RDF [[rdf11-concepts]].
		Now that OSLC Core 3.0 specifications are based on [[LINKED-DATA]] and namely the Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], 
		there is a less-disruptive change from 2.0 to 3.0, as conceptually they are built on the same foundation: HTTP and RDF.
		Some of the underlying concepts and vocabularies may have changed in some areas, which this document will address
		how best to co-exist with 2.0 existing implementations.  Which in the end, will mostly be able just producing a few more 
		RDF triples (or statements) in some of the responses or additional HTTP response headers.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="terms">
		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's
			Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],  Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
		<p>No additional terminology defined.</p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>There will be a period of time to allow for both the adoption of the 3.0 specification and the deployment of those clients and servers.</p>

<h2>Changes from OSLC Core 2.0</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes the capabilities from OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications and 
what changes have occurred within OSLC Core 3.0. <strong>It is not a complete list of all differences.</strong>
As additional OSLC Core specifications are published, this table may be out of date and changes needed.  The 
individual specifications and associated TCs will produce any needed backwards/forwards or cross dependency collateral.</p>
    
<p>Many capabilities are no longer specified in OSLC 3.0 because they are part of the W3C Linked Data
    Platform 1.0 [[LDP]]. Servers can continue to support both 2.0 and 3.0
    capabilities for backwards compatibility with 2.0 clients.</p>

<p>Some capabilities are in both OSLC 2.0 and OSLC 3.0, but their
    implementation has changed. One example is Resource Preview
    [[OSLCPreview3]].</p>

<p>Note that the required resource representations have changed. In 2.0, these were often specialized
at a domain level, such as RDF/XML and  OSLC JSON representations may been required. Turtle [[turtle]] and JSON-LD
    [[JSON-LD]] are required instead, this is a [[LDP]] requirement.</p>

<section>
	<h2>OSLC-Core-Version</h2>
	<p>Deprecated.  Technically, there is no to carry it forward in 3.0.  Each capability should be able to accurately describe
	how to discover it using methods established by LDP such as HTTP response headers (Link relations, Accept-Post, ...).</p>
	<p>Implementations that have previously tested for the value of this parameter, should ensure their logic properly accounts for
	values that may not be "2.0".  As some may provide the value of "3.0", which shouldn't be seen as an error but instead as just
	an informative header.</p>
