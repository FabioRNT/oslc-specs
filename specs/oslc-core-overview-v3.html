		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With strong demand for better support of integrated system and software processes, 
enterprises want products from different vendors, open source projects and their own 
homegrown components to work together. This level of integration, however, can become 
quite challenging and unmanageable. In order to support integration between a 
heterogeneous set of products and components from various sources, there is a need 
for an architecture that is minimalist, loosely coupled, and standardized. OSLC 
is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), 
to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services and 
other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully. [[LDP]]</p>

<p>OSLC is motivated by domain scenarios such as change management, requirement 
management, and quality management, as well as by cross-domain scenarios such as 
Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), and 
Integrated Service Management (ISM). Though the OSLC approach is may apply to many
other domains and cross-domain scenarios, it focuses its efforts to ensure it meets
a core set of requirements.</p>

<p>The OSLC Core specifications are responsible for providing additional capabilities that
expand W3C LDP concepts, as needed, to enable integration. It defines the essential 
technical elements of OSLC specifications and offers guidance on common concerns for 
creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources based on W3C LDP [[LDP]]. 
These specifications are motivated and sometimes based on best practices and on the work of 
other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs. The OSLC Lifecycle Integration Core TC develops technical specifications, create 
best practices documents and formulate design principles that can be leveraged by 
other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs to enable them to focus on domain-specific concerns.</p>

<p>This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 efforts, which takes the learning from that effort along
with the common foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that are: simpler, have 
layered capabilities and easier to adopt.</p>

	<section id="terms">
		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's
			Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]] and Hyper-text
			Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
		<dl class="glossary">
			<dt>Link</dt>
			<dd>
				A relationship between two resources when one resource
				(representation) refers to the other resource by means of a URI
				[[WEBARCH]].
				<p></p>
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<em>Deprecated terms</em>
		<p>In previous revisions of OSLC-based specifications, there was
			terminology used based that may longer be relevant, accurate or
			needed anymore. Some of those deprecated terms are:
		<dl class="glossary deprecated">
			<dt>Provider</dt>
			<dd>See Server [[HTTP11]]. Provider is a legacy term from OSLC Core 2.0. [[]]</dd>

			<dt>Consumer</dt>
			<dd>See Client [[HTTP11]]. Consumer is a legacy term from OSLC Core 2.0. [[]]</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>Goals/Motivation</h2>
		<em>Scenario-driven</em>
		<p>Every capability or vocabulary term should be linked back to
			key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important
			not only for knowing the correct specification content is being
			developed but also to assist with implementers understanding the
			intended usage.</p>

		<em>Incremental</em>
		<p>Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion
			that not only validates the technical approaches but also delivers
			integration value sooner.</p>

		<em>Loose-coupling</em>
		<p>Specifications should support a model where clients have little
			to no knowledge about server implementation-specific behaviors in
			order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients
			should be able to not be impacted by any server application software
			or data model changes. Similarly, client software should be able to
			be independently changed without.</p>

		<em>Minimalistic</em>
		<p>Specification developers should strive to find not only the
			simplest solution that would work for a given scenario but allows for
			easy adoption by defining solutions that are minimalistic in nature.
		</p>

		<em>Capabilities</em>
		<p>A collection of near independent capabilities. These
			capabilities can incrementally defined as specifications and
			independently discovered at runtime. Even though there may be some
			generally agreed upon best practices for capability discovery, each
			capability should define how a it is discovered.</p>

		<em>Vocabularies</em>
		<p>Various OASIS OSLC affiliated TCs, or any specification
			development body that is defining working on a specific knowledge
			domain, will primarily define vocabularies and the semantics behind
			the various terms. Domain specifications should simply be domain
			vocabularies, leveraging protocol capabilities defined by W3C Linked
			Data Platform. Domain vocabulary terms should be developed with
			global reuse in mind. Some global reuse considerations are when terms
			are used for cross domain queries and within other domain resource
			shape definitions. Domain resource shapes should be used to define
			resources based on a set of terms, which introduces any domain
			specific constraints on its usage.</p>

			<h2>Evolution</h2>
			<p>At some point there may be common enough groupings of these

		<section class='informative'>
			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<p>Specifications should typically be organized into separate
				capability specifications. Those capabilities may be groups together
				into a package for ease of reference and promotion through
				standardization. Typical sections one would find in a capabilities
				specifications would be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Introduction</strong> - general information about
					background and what is covered in the document</li>
				<li><strong>Motivation</strong> - reference to use cases and
					requirements</li>
				<li><strong>Capability</strong> - details of the capability
					being defined, another title may be appropriate
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Shapes</strong> - types and their properties with
							any constraints.</li>
						<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - how does a client discover
							this capability</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li><strong>Appendix: RDF Vocabulary</strong> - RDF terms defined
					by this spec, should be have global context in mind and should</li>
