    <p>This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web
      services interface for the management of product change requests, activities,
      tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural
      resources. To support these scenarios, this specification
      defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET,
      POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource
      formats.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>(this section is informative)</p>

    <p>Reconciliation, as referenced in this specification, refers to the case where there exists a need to understand
      if multiple providers are referring to the same resource, particularly when there is not already a common
      identifier that all providers populate. For example, an IT environment discovery tool reports that it finds a
      computer using an IP address of 192.168.0.1 ; and a monitoring tools reports that CPU usage on the machine with
      hostname example1.domain.com. A system administrator would previously have to rely on experience or have to lookup
      manually that both tools are referring to the same physical resource. In HTTP terms, we want to determine that a
      set of URIs refer to the same “non-information resource” entity. See the <a
        href="https://archive.open-services.net/wiki/reconciliation/Reconciliation-Scenarios/index.html"
        title="Reconciliation-Scenarios">Reconciliation Scenarios</a> page
      for several specific examples.</p>

    <p>This specification builds on the [[!OSLCCore2]] to define the resources and operations supported by Open Services
      for Lifecycle Collaboration
      (OSLC) providers who have a need to reconcile resource instance information with other providers.</p>

    <p>The goal of this effort is to define resources, methods and constraints such that disparate tools can recognize
      that their data describes the same entity or concept (non-information resource). Reconcilable resources describe
      individual entities, including their relationships to other resources inside and/or outside of the Reconciliation
      domain.</p>

      <h2>Compliance</h2>

      <p class=‘conformance’>
        This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore2]]. OSLC Reconciliation domain consumers and service providers
        MUST be
        compliant with both the Core specification and this specification, and SHOULD follow all the
        guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.
      </p>

      <p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as additional requirements
        specific to the Reconciliation domain.</p>

      <p>Note that this specification further restricts some of the requirements from the OSLC Core Specification as
        noted in the Origin column of the compliance table. See further sections in this specification or the OSLC Core
        Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.</p>

      <p class=‘conformance’>Any consumer or service provider behaviors are allowed unless explicitly prohibited by this
        or dependent
        specifications; conditional permissive requirements, especially those qualified with MAY, are
        implicitly covered by the preceding clause. While technically redundant in light of that broad permission, OSLC
        specifications do still make explicit MAY-qualified statements in cases where the editors believe doing so is
        likely to add clarity.</p>

        informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship
        property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.) <a
          href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecAppendixLinks.html">OSLC Core Links Guidance</a> allows OSLC
        providers to support a <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in resource representations, using the anchor
        approach (reification), but this specification discourages its use (providers SHOULD NOT use
        it, and consumers SHOULD NOT depend on it). At the time this specification was written, the W3C
        RDF working group was on a path to remove reification from the next version of RDF, and it was noted that
        reification never was normatively defined even in the RDF/XML syntax W3C Recommendation, where it occurs

    <h2>Conformance</h2>

    <p>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC CM servers
      MUST be compliant with both the core specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative
      sections of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both
      these specifications.</p>

    <p>An OSLC CM server MUST implement the domain vocabulary defined in <a
        href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-domains/cm/v3.0/cm-v3.0-part2-change-mgt-vocab.html">OSLC Change
        Management Version 3.0. Part 2: Vocabulary</a>

      <p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification
        as well as some additional requirements specific to the CM domain. Note that
        this specification further restricts some of the requirements for OSLC Core
        Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the
        OSLC Core Specification to get further details on each of these
        requirements.</p>
