		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With strong demand for better support of integrated system and software processes, 
enterprises want products from different vendors, open source projects and their own 
homegrown components to work together. This level of integration, however, can become 
quite challenging and unmanageable. In order to support integration between a 
heterogeneous set of products and components from various sources, there is a need 
for an architecture that is minimalist, loosely coupled, and standardized. OSLC 
is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), 
to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services and 
other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully. [[LDP]]</p>

<p>OSLC is motivated by domain scenarios such as change management, requirement 
management, and quality management, as well as by cross-domain scenarios such as 
Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), and 
Integrated Service Management (ISM). Though the OSLC approach is may apply to many
other domains and cross-domain scenarios, it focuses its efforts to ensure it meets
a core set of requirements.</p>

<p>The OSLC Core specifications are responsible for providing additional capabilities that
expand W3C LDP concepts, as needed, to enable integration. It defines the essential 
technical elements of OSLC specifications and offers guidance on common concerns for 
creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources based on W3C LDP [[LDP]]. 
These specifications are motivated and sometimes based on best practices and on the work of 
other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs, sometime referred to as OSLC domain TCs as the focus on a certain domain or topic. 
The OSLC Lifecycle Integration Core TC develops technical specifications, create 
best practices documents and formulate design principles that can be leveraged by 
other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs to enable them to focus on domain-specific concerns.</p>

</figure>

<p>As seen in <a href="#fig-oslc-core-3.0-overview"></a>, there are a number of capabilities developed in different
standards organizations, TCs and working groups.  The arrows represent either dependencies or extensions to some specifications or
capabilities.  It is recommended that OSLC MS-affiliated TC developed specifications depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications,
though the real goal is to minimize dependencies, which may override the need to depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

<p>This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 efforts, which takes the learning from that effort along
with the common foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that are: simpler, have 
layered capabilities and easier to adopt.</p>

		<section id='deprecatedterms'>
		<h2>Deprecated terms</h2>
		<p>In previous revisions of OSLC-based specifications [[OSLCCore2]], there was
			terminology used based that may longer be relevant, accurate or
			needed anymore. Some of those deprecated terms are:
		<dl class="glossary">
			<dt>Provider (<em>deprecated</em>)</dt>
			<dd>See Server [[HTTP11]].</dd>

			<dt>Consumer (<em>deprecated</em>)</dt>
			<dd>See Client [[HTTP11]].</dd>
		</dl>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Goals/Motivation</h2>
		
		
		<em class='loc-heading'>Scenario-driven</em>
		<p>Every capability or vocabulary term should be linked back to
			key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important
			not only for knowing the correct specification content is being
			developed but also to assist with implementers understanding the
			intended usage.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Incremental</em>
		<p>Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion
			that not only validates the technical approaches but also delivers
			integration value sooner.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Loose-coupling</em>
		<p>Specifications should support a model where clients have little
			to no knowledge about server implementation-specific behaviors in
			order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients
			should be able to not be impacted by any server application software
			or data model changes. Similarly, client software should be able to
			be independently changed without.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Minimalistic</em>
		<p>Specification developers should strive to find not only the
			simplest solution that would work for a given scenario but allows for
			easy adoption by defining solutions that are minimalistic in nature.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Capabilities</em>
		<p>A collection of near independent capabilities. These
			capabilities can incrementally defined as specifications and
			independently discovered at runtime. Even though there may be some
			generally agreed upon best practices for capability discovery, each
			capability should define how a it is discovered.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Vocabularies</em>
		<p>Various OASIS OSLC affiliated TCs, or any specification
			development body that is defining working on a specific knowledge
			domain, will primarily define vocabularies and the semantics behind
			the various terms. Domain specifications should simply be domain
			vocabularies, leveraging protocol capabilities defined by W3C Linked
			Data Platform. Domain vocabulary terms should be developed with
			global reuse in mind. Some global reuse considerations are when terms
			are used for cross domain queries and within other domain resource
			shape definitions. Domain resource shapes should be used to define
			resources based on a set of terms, which introduces any domain
			specific constraints on its usage.</p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<p>In support of the previously stated goals and motivation, along with lifecycle integration scenario motivating 
		requirements for specifications, it is desired to have a consistent and recommend architecture.  To support scenarios
		where there needs to be a protocol to access, create, update and delete resources: which HTTP is the foundation for this [[HTTP11]]. 
		These resources need to relate, or link,
		to one another utilizing a consistent, standard and web-scale data model: which Resource Description Framework (RDF) [[rdf11-concepts]] is the foundation for this.  The
		ability to work with these data models over HTTP protocols, is based on [[LDP]].  </p>
		
		<p>Some scenarios, require the need to integrate user interface components: either within a web-browser, mobile device,
		rich desktop applications.  For these scenarios, the technology is rapidly evolving and changing.  Priority will be be
		based on existing standards such as HTML5, with use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>. [[HTML5]</p>
		
		<p>Various OSLC Core specifications will elaborate on the conformance requirements leveraging these various technologies and
		approaches.</p>

		<p>As the primary goals have been outlined around lifecycle integration, some scenarios may require exploration of new (or different)
		approaches and technologies.  As with all specification development efforts, the OSLC Core TC will advise, develop and approve
		such efforts through the established processes for cross-TC and organization coordination.</p>

		<h2>Specification outline</h2>
		<div class="todo">TODO: Consider removing this and putting just in wiki or somewhere else.</div>
		<p>Specifications follow the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">OASIS TC process</a> towards standardization and each OSLC-affiliated TC will make the determination
		which documents are needed and which should be on the standards-track.</p>
		<p>Specifications developed by OSLC-affiliated TCs should follow consistent structure and style, based on OASIS requirements.
		A <a href="http://sspeiche.github.io/respec/examples/oslc/template-spec.html">template</a> is available which provides the preferred structure and 
		what is expected in various sections.</p>
		<p>Some of the key sections are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Introduction</strong> - plus a simple working example using the capability</li>
			<li><strong>Terminology</strong> - new terms</li>
			<li><strong>Motivation</strong> - reference to key background, use cases and
				requirements</li>
			<li><strong>Basic Concepts</strong> - elaboration of terms, summary of capabilities</li>
			<li><strong>Capability</strong> - details of the capability
				being defined, another title may be appropriate
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Shapes</strong> - types and their properties with
							any constraints.</li>
						<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - how does a client discover
							this capability</li>
					</ul></li>
			<li><strong>Appendix: RDF Vocabulary</strong> - RDF terms defined
				by this spec, should be have global context in mind and should</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>In addition to these, there may be need to be supporting material to address backwards and forwards
		version compatibility.  These may be either in the form of additional content in the current document
		or a supplemental document.</p>
